should all raw input be sanitized (i.e. converted to lower case etc.)?
create config file with clustering parameters
do preprocessing on inQuery and inDocument (drop dummy column)
use threshold for score in parse_score.py ?
make sure all scripts that use ExploreEM truncate the unused input files
sort all input (instead of just assuming that it is sorted)
automate reporting (el_scorer and exploreEM statistics)
use vpath directive: vpath %.py src/*; vpath %.txt data
use .DELETE_ON_ERROR for data files
problem: proppr removes names with special characters (should not matter for 
exploratory version -> string is just one feature)
