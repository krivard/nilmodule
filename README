Configuration
-------------

Befor installing and running the code it is necessary to specify the paths to
the external data (e.g., ProPPR output). This has to be done in the first
section of the Makefile. The necessary files are:

[description]
- PROPPR_TEST
- PROPPR_TRAIN 
- QNAME 
- SCORE_TEST 
- SCORE_TRAIN 
- TOKEN 
- QSENT 
- INSENT 
- TACPR 

It is also possible to specify the amount of padding (e.g., the number of "X"
in "NILXXX") by changing the FORMATTING_FLAGS.

Installation
------------

Run "make" inside the main directory. This will set up a virtual environment
with the necessary python dependencies and then run the different clustering
scripts. If you only want to install the virtual environment without running 
the clustering scripts, use "make venv" instead. 

Running the code
----------------

The makefile provides several targets corresponding to the different steps of
the clustering process:

- "make raw" will generate all the input needed for the different 
clustering algorithms. 

- "make baseline" will run the baseline clustering algorithms. At the moment,
there are the following baseline algorithms:
    -- baseline0:   string only. All queries with the same query string are
                    assigned the same nid.
    -- baseline1:   string and did. All queries with the same query string and
                    the same did are assigned the same nid.
    -- baseline2:   string and document distance. Queries that have the same 
                    query string are assigned to different clusters based on
                    the distance between the documents they appear in.
                    Agglomerative clustering is used. The clustering parameters
                    (pairwise distance measure between documents, distance 
                    measure between clusters, clustering method and threshold 
                    for flattening) can be specified in the makefile.
    -- baseline3:   string and document distance. Same as baseline2, but 
                    instead of agglomerative clustering exploratory clustering
                    is used.  
    -- baseline4: 
    -- baseline5: 
    -- baseline6: 
    -- baseline7:
